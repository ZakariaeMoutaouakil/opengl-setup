# Simplest OpenGL Setup with Modern CMake

The easiest way to set up an OpenGL project is using modern CMake's FetchContent capability, which automatically downloads and configures all required dependencies. You only need a C++ compiler and CMake installed on your system - no manual library installations required. Using FetchContent, CMake will automatically fetch GLFW (for window creation and OpenGL context management) and GLAD (for loading OpenGL functions) from their respective GitHub repositories. GLFW handles the platform-specific tasks of creating windows and handling input, while GLAD manages the loading of OpenGL function pointers, making your OpenGL code portable across different platforms. With this approach, you can have a working OpenGL setup in minutes without dealing with system-specific package managers or manual library downloads.

Note: During the first build, you might encounter errors due to missing development packages. On Linux, you might need packages like libx11-dev, libxrandr-dev, libxinerama-dev, libxcursor-dev, libxi-dev, and libxext-dev. On Windows, you might need Python installed (with jinja2 package) for GLAD generation. Don't worry - just install the missing packages as the build errors indicate them and rebuild. The error messages will guide you to the specific packages needed for your system.
